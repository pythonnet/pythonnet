    <description>A set of compile-time libraries (nothing to deploy) and a build task that enable you to export functions from managed code to native applications.
      That means, you can create plugins in a managed language like C# or F# for native applications that only have a C-Api (like Notepad++).
      The nuget package is all you need. Just mark your methods with [DllExport] and build.

      Hints:
      - You have to set your platform target to either x86, ia64 or x64. AnyCPU assemblies cannot export functions.
      - The export name defaults to the method name and the calling convention to stdcall. If that's all what you want, you can just use [DllExport] without parameters.
      - You cannot put your exports in generic types or export gegenric methods, but your parameters or the result can use generics.
      e.g.:
      [DllExport]
      static void Test(YourStruct&lt;int&gt; data){}</description>
    <summary>Adds the ability to declare unmanaged function exports.
      IOW: the exact opposite of how DllImport works.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>- Placing [DllExport] on non-static methods will now yield an error.
      - Placing [DllExport] on methods in generic types (or types nested in generic types) will yield an error.
      - Errors regarding lib.exe will no longer break the build.
      - Added support for generic return types. Even the most esotheric corner cases (obfuscated types) should work.
      - Made the code that checks method names and class names much more resilient and faster.
      - Most messages are localizable now (and I translated them to German).</releaseNotes>
